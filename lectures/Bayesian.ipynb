    "#### Extensions\n",
    "[Chernozhukov and Hong (2003) \"An MCMC Approach to Classical Estimation\"](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407603001003) is a very interesting article\n",
    "that shows how Bayesian methods may be used with criterion functions that are associated with\n",
    "classical estimation techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when the criterion function $L_n(\\theta)$ in their paper is set to the log-likelihoodfunction and the pseudo-prior $\\pi(\\theta)$ is a real Bayesian prior, the class of estimators discussed by CH reduces to the ordinary Bayesian posterior mean. this estimator is consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. In\n",
    "particular, the Bayesian posterior mean has the same asymptotic distribution as does the ordinary\n",
    "maximum likelihood estimator.\n",
    "- the intuition is clear: as the amount of information coming from the\n",
    "sample increases, the likelihood function brings an increasing amount\n",
    "of information, relative to the prior. Eventually, the prior is no\n",
    "longer important for determining the shape of the posterior.\n",
    "- when the sample is large, the shape of the posterior depends on the\n",
    "likelihood function. The likelihood function collapses around $\\theta_{0}$\n",
    "when the sample is generated at $\\theta_{0}.$ The same is true of\n",
    "the posterior, it narrows around $\\theta_{0}$. This causes the posterior\n",
    "mean to converge to the true parameter value. In fact, all quantiles\n",
    "of the posterior converge to $\\theta_{0}$. Chernozhukov and Hong\n",
    "discuss estimators defined using quantiles.\n",
    "- For an econometrician coming from the frequentist perspective, this\n",
    "is attractive. The Bayesian estimator has the same asymptotic behavior\n",
    "as the MLE. There may be computational advantages to using the Bayesian\n",
    "approach, because there is no need for optimization. If the objective\n",
    "function that defines the classical estimator is irregular (multiple\n",
    "local optima, nondifferentiabilities, noncontinuities...), then optimization\n",
    "may be very difficult. However, Bayesian methods that use integration\n",
    "may be more tractable. This is the main motivation of CH's paper.\n",
    "Additional advantages include the benefits if an informative prior\n",
    "is available. When this is the case, the Bayesian estimator can have\n",
    "better small sample performance than the maximum likelihood estimator."
